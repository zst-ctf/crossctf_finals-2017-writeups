# Govtech Binary Challenge 
#### Level 1 - 75

### Challenge
> I wonder what's happening in the class les!
I have been waiting a really long time for this...
[File here](dist.zip)

### Solution

Decompile the `.class` files and you will see the flag in `Main.java`
	
	public static String flag1 = "flag1{7171a60f8cf4a789b7fa5906aa78f3e7}";

*Note: The flag is not in the format of `CrossCTF{}` which is really misleading.*
